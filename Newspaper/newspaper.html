                    <p class="info" margin="20%"><b>What is ChatGPT?</b> ChatGPT is a GPT-3-based natural language processing tool that allows users to have human-like conversations with an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot. GPT-3.5 is a language model trained to produce text. OpenAI introduced an enhanced version of GPT-4 Turbo on Wednesday, making it accessible through an Application Programming Interface (API) and for subscribers of ChatGPT Plus, several media outlets reported. GPT-4 Turbo represents the company's latest generative AI model, now trained with data up to December 2023.
                        The updated model boasts new data processing capabilities, enabling analysis of text in JSON format and executing function calls to generate JSON code snippets. </p>
                    </p>
                        <p class="info"> snippets empower developers to automate tasks within their connected applications, such as sending emails, posting online, or making purchases, as reported by The Indian Express.With a context window now expanded to accommodate up to 128,000 tokens, developers can leverage the new API capability to deploy GPT-4 Turbo for image analysis, including food recognition from various global cuisines. Additionally, the model demonstrates enhanced proficiency in generating computer code. Developers with access to the GPT-4 Turbo API can seamlessly integrate the latest model into their applications and services, the national-daily said.</p>

                        <b>A recently released report by Deloitte,</b> 'Technology Trends 2024: India Perspective', found that India will emerge as a key player in domains such as spatial computing, the industrial metaverse, cloud computing, and generative AI (GenAI).
                    </p>
                    <p class="info">    
                        The report stated that India is adopting new technology faster than many other countries. For instance, AI-related initiatives surged nearly three times between 2023 and 2024, with over 650,000 employees undergoing GenAI skills training, according to the report.

                        In 2024, the focus will be on identifying investment areas and evaluating outcomes. GenAI holds immense promise but also carries risks such as misinformation and synthetic media. Enterprises must manage GenAI-related risks through integrated risk mitigation and governance processes. India’s tech ecosystem is advancing with increased software exports, tech workforce growth, tier-2 city development, government support, and improved infrastructure, solidifying its position as a reliable tech talent hub.
